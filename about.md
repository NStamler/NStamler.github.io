Hello! This is a personal tracker for when New York City is in a COVID wave. A wave is defined as a rapid spike in COVID-19 cases, following and followed by a lull when there is no change in the 7-day average case counts. Data is retreived from [NYC Health](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/data-by-day.csv) and processed in MATLAB. I try to update this website at least once a week.

### Disclaimer
This is an unofficial tracker. It is not affiliated with any official City or Health agencies. None of the contributors to this website, in any way whatsoever, can be responsible for your use of the information contained in or linked from this website. Please take all steps necessary to ascertain that information you receive about COVID-19 is correct and has been verified.

Stay safe.
