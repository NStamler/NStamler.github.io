Hello! This is a tracker for when New York City is in a COVID wave. A wave is defined as a rapid spike in COVID-19 cases, following and followed by a lull when there is no change in the 7-day average case counts. Data is retreived from [NYC Health](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/data-by-day.csv) and processed in MATLAB. I try to update this website at least once a week.

### Resources
The [NYC COVID-19 Citywide Information Portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/resources/resources-for-new-yorkers.page) provides resources offering food, employment, health insurance, housing and more. Learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine from the [NYC Vaccine Command Center](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/coronavirus/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines.page).

Please take all steps necessary to ascertain that information you receive about COVID-19 is correct and has been verified.
